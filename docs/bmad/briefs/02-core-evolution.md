# Phase 2: Soul Kiln Core Evolution

> **Status:** Waiting for Phase 1 learnings

## Purpose

Feed application-layer learnings back into soul_kiln core. This phase begins after significant Phase 1 progress reveals gaps, friction, or opportunities.

---

## Expected Evolution Areas

### Virtue Dynamics
- Which virtues matter most in application context?
- Are the 19 virtues sufficient? Too many? Missing any?
- How do virtue basins behave under real conversational load?

### Coherence Testing
- Current metrics: capture rate, coverage, dominance
- Application needs: response quality, user satisfaction, task completion
- Bridge needed: virtue coherence → application coherence

### Mercy System
- How does mercy translate to user-facing failures?
- What constitutes "harm" in application context?
- How do lessons from one user help others (anonymized)?

### Knowledge Pool
- What patterns emerge from collective use?
- How should pathways form between domain concepts and virtues?
- What's the right balance of shared vs. private knowledge?

### Performance
- Graph query latency under concurrent agents
- Memory (Graphiti) retrieval speed
- Evolution cycle timing with bound agents excluded

## Inputs Required (from Phase 1)

- [ ] Friction log: where did soul_kiln make application development hard?
- [ ] Missing primitives: what did we build that should be core?
- [ ] Metric gaps: what couldn't we measure that we needed to?
- [ ] Pattern library: what worked that should be extracted?

---

## Potential Stories (TBD)

Will be defined based on Phase 1 learnings. Anticipated areas:

1. **Virtue refinement** - Adjust or extend the 19 virtues
2. **Coherence metrics v2** - Application-aware coherence testing
3. **Mercy system extensions** - User-facing failure recovery
4. **Knowledge pooling** - Cross-agent learning patterns
5. **Performance optimization** - Concurrent agent support

---

## Timeline

Begins when Phase 1 reaches "functional MVP" milestone (Tracks A + B complete).
